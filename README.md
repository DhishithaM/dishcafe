AUTHORS: Dhishitha Madhvan

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Once user terminal window opened look carefully at questions before answering.
If you enter an answer that does not comply with the choices available you will be given a statement telling you to change your answer.
Proper answer format is given in either the question, error message, or the detailed available options above the question.
Look at question to see which is most relevant.
Sometimes the available options gives you more information for user knowledge such as for size options.

Example displayed for user:

Available size options:
* small (8 oz), medium (12oz), regular (16oz), large (20 oz) 

What size would you like for your drink? Please type small, medium, regular or large.


User would type in small, medium, regular or large, NOT small 8(oz) or 8 oz. 
Though for cases such as coffee type or tea type user can type in americano just like in the available coffee options! 
As a rule of thumb always read the question carefully for specification on what to type for answer.
Even if you make a mistake though it's ok! My program will keep asking you the question till you give it in proper format.
And if you want to change your mind on your order at the end you can cancel your order and create a new drink or get multiple drinks!
Once having gone through all the questions you will then recieve your drink and a goodbye parting message!
